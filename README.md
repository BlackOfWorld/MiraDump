# :mag: GameOffsetDumper

## This project isn't completed yet. The description below is based on my future anticipation:)

GameOffsetDumper finds offsets of various games by pattern scanning the entire module according to the signature you pass.
Basically this would help game hackers and sadly if you guys not know how to reverse games and stuff, this is gonna be a trash for you.

This software offers what [hazedumper](https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper-rs) gives you.
However I just wanted to implement it on my own to comprehend what's going on in it.

Additionally, regarding differentiation, this software adopted toml instead of json, so using this is more intuitive than hazedumper I hope.
