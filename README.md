Leave a **:star:star** if you find this helpful :)

**GameOffsetDumper** finds offsets of various games by pattern scanning the entire module according to the signature you pass.

Basically this would help game hackers and sadly if you guys don't know how to reverse games and stuff, this is gonna be a trash for you.

# Progress
The project is almost completed. I'm going to brush up a bit and make sure if this works on various games, and I'll make a new release. It will take a few days.

# Get started

Firstly, prepare config.toml file in the same directory as GameOffsetDumper.exe and fill it up properly.

Then run this software and every offset will be searched through whole module and written to GameOffset.hpp.

HERE WILL BE UPDATED LATER ON

Regarding the differentiation from hazedumper, this software adopted toml instead of json, so using this is more intuitive than hazedumper I hope.
